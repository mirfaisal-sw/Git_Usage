============================================
"git status" shows too many modified files
============================================

If "git status" shows too many modified files even if those files were not 
modified, then this is because git is considering changed file permissions 
also.
To avoid this we run following command: -

# For the current repository
$git config core.filemode false   

# Globally
$git config --global core.filemode false
