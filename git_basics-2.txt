1.) We can change behaviour of git and we can set various Git attributes using 
    file - ~/.gitconfig.
    
    Example: - Content of file ".gitconfig" can be as below.
    [color]
        ui = auto
        
    [user]
        name = Mir Faisal
        email = mir.faisal@harman.com
        
    [editor]
        default = vim
        
    [core]
        editor = vim
        
2.) To set default editor in Git: -
    # git config --global core.editor "vim"
        
3.) To see Git log in single line for different commits: -
    # git log --oneline
    
4.) To see staged changes only file name: -
    # git diff --cached --name-only
    
5.) To see only staged changes: -
    # git diff --cached
    
6.) To delete top commit with commit ID: -
    # git reset --hard <commit ID>
    
7.) To see help on any git command, use --help option as below.
    Example: -
    # git am --help
    #git commit --help

8.) Filter git log by the name of author or commiter, as below.
    # git log --author="Mir Faisal"
    # git log --committer="Mir Faisal"
    
9.) To see the available releases run below command: -
    # git tag
    
10.) Git cherrypick: -
Suppose there are two branches feature-1 and feature-2 and we want to take a commit of feature-1 
to feature-2. For this we will do following steps.
    i. Checkout to feature-1 branch.
        # git checkout feature-1
    ii. Run "git log" and copy Hash of the commit (six characters is enough) to be cherrypicked.
    iii. Now switch to feature2 and run git cherry-pick on the hash you just got from the log.
        # git checkout feature-2
        # git cherrypick <Hash of the commit copied in step - II>
