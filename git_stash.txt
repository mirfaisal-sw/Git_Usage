Git stash usage: - 
=====================

1. Suppose we do not want to commit our local changes and want to keep it as backup, so that 
any other git operations like "git pull" etc can be done. So, to do this git stash command 
can be used.

# git stash

Now, once we want to restore stashed changes, which are backup of uncomitted local changes, then we can run 
below command - 
# git stash pop
